uriutils 0.1
============

Working with multiple storage platforms (i.e., local filesystem, S3, Google Cloud, etc.) can be quite a hassle.
This package aims to make it transparent to the user and the developer the underlying storage system by wrapping the different protocols in a common interface.

Usage
-----

See `uriutils-0.1 documentation <https://skylander86.github.io/uriutils/>`_.
